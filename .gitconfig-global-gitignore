# this file is a a gitignore file but is applied across all repos that this user
# interacts with. to make use of this file, run the following command:
#
# git config --global core.excludesfile "~/.gitconfig-global-gitignore"
# (the double quotes prevent your shell from expanding the ~)

# ignore vim swap files since they pollute my tab completion results.
# the only bad side effect is that i won't be able to quickly see what vim swap
# files exist the repo. i think it's still worth it.
#
# technically, multiple swap files can exist for a file being edited, but i only
# ever have one
