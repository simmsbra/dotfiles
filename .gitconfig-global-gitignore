# this file is a gitignore file but is applied across all repos that this user
# interacts with. to make use of this file, either run the following command:
#
# git config --global --add core.excludesfile "~/.gitconfig-global-gitignore"
# (the double quotes prevent your shell from expanding the ~)
#
# or set the same option manually by editing your .gitconfig file setup

# ignore vim swap files since they pollute tab completion results.
# the only bad side effect is that you won't be able to quickly see what vim
# swap files exist in the repo. i think it's still worth it.
#
# technically, multiple swap files can exist for a file being edited, but i only
# ever have one
